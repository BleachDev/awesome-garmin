# Awesome Garmin

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of awesome Garmin application, both for Garmin devices and other
tools.

The idea is to mainly collect open source projects written in [Monkey C] but
also serve as a resource base for everything Garmin development related. This
includes tools to enhance your Garmin experience, tools around Garmin
development and more.

> **NOTE**: This README is generated!
> To help exploring relevant resources the items in each segmented are _sorted
> by last activity_ if available.

> _This README was last generated at 2024-01-29_.

Any contributions are much appreciated! To add a new resource, **do not edit
this file**! Instead, add it to [`awesome.toml`][awesome-toml]. If it's a GitHub
repository with a description you only need to add the URL. To add a custom
name, set `name`, to add a description if missing, set `description`.

## Watch faces

[Watch faces] are a special application type that display on the main screen of
Garmin’s wearable devices. These application types are limited some ways to
allow them to have minimal impact on the device’s battery life.

## Data fields

[Data fields] allow customers and third party developers to write additional
metrics and data that will display with Garmin activities. The goal is to create
a system that not only makes it easy for a user to make a quick data field based
off our workout data, but also gives the developer the the ability to customize
the presentation.

## Widgets

[Widgets] are mini-apps that allow developers to provide glanceable views of
information. The information may be from a cloud service, from the onboard
sensors, or from other Connect IQ APIs. Widgets are launchable from a rotating
carousel of pages accessible from the main screen of wearables, or from a side
view on bike computers and outdoor handhelds. Unlike apps, Widgets time out
after a period of inactivity and are not allowed to record activities, but they
are also launchable at any time.

## Device Apps

Applications, or [Device Apps], are by far the most robust type of app
available. These allow the most flexibility and customization to the app
designer. They also provide the most access to the capabilities of the wearable
device, such as accessing ANT+ sensors, the accelerometer and reading/recording
FIT files.

## Audio content providers

[Audio content providers]. Garmin media enabled devices are designed for active
lifestyle users who want to listen to music without carrying their phone on
their rides, runs or other activities. The media player allows the user to
listen to their music, podcasts, and audio-books on the go.


## Barrels

Developers can create custom Monkey C libraries, called [Monkey Barrels], that
contain source code and resource information that are easily shared across
Connect IQ Projects.
